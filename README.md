# Flow Builder

## Live Demo: https://flowbuilder-drab.vercel.app/

This  flow builder template provides a minimal setup to get up & running with a flow builder for creating & connecting multiple message nodes together to decide the order of execution.

Made with [React](http://reactjs.org) and [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/).



Currently, the following features are available:

- Our flow builder currently supports only one type of message (i.e Text Message) inside the Nodes panel but it is extensible.
- Source Handle connections are limited to one connection to make it easy to decide the order of execution of flow builder.
- Unlimited number of connections to the target Handle.
- Settings Panel will replace the Nodes Panel when a Node is selected. It has a text field to edit text of the selected Text Node.
- Currently we support only Dark Mode.
